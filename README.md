# Dwindling attention spans have ruined social media.

If your social media feeds are anything like mine, you undoubtedly get posts stolen from subreddits read over top of some *Subway Surfers* or *Minecraft* gameplay. These videos are repetitive and dull, so much so that one night I figured that they could be automatically made without any input. I threw this together in an evening just to see if it was possible. If you would like to try it out make sure you create a Reddit API app and put in your info where the comments say below!

## Required packages
